## Work In Progress
Thank you for your contribution. 

For now, I would like to take the time to unravel Zyod's potential going forward. This is until I finish establishing the foundation of Zyod. When the foundation is complete I will then create contributors file providing context on Zyod, guidelines, & how it works.

Here are some of the components Zyod will have or already has:

- Command line argument parsing
- Navigators  
- Web Drivers
- OD Identifiers
- Scrapers/Joiners
- Downloader
- Recorder
- Filters
	+ Scraper/Joiners
	+ Downloader
- Multi-threading

## Contributing

You can still contribute by finding Dynamic ODs *(Open Directories)* Zyod currently does not support. Specifically, ODs that will only load if JavaScript is enabled. **Be sure to create an issue for it**.

Here is an example of the [GDIndex demo OD](https://gdindex-demo.maple3142.workers.dev). Try disabling JavaScript & refreshing the page. The OD, for the most part, will show nothing. It is as if the OD never existed.
