## Find Dynamic ODs

You can contribute by finding Dynamic ODs *(Open Directories)* Zyod currently does not support.
Specifically, ODs that will only load if JavaScript is enabled. **Be sure to create an issue for
it**.

Here is an example of the [GDIndex demo OD](https://gdindex-demo.maple3142.workers.dev).
Try disabling JavaScript & refreshing the page. The OD, for the most part, will show nothing.
It is as if the OD never existed.
